The main idea of the SDLC has been "to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, requiring each stage of the life cycle––from inception of the idea to delivery of the final system––to be carried out rigidly and sequentially"

			Methodologies, processes, and frameworks range from specific proscriptive steps that can be used directly by an organization in day-to-day work, to flexible frameworks that an organization uses to generate a custom set of steps tailored to the needs of a specific project or group.  In some cases a "sponsor" or "maintenance" organization distributes an official set of documents that describe the process.  Specific examples include:

			Several software development approaches have been used since the origin of information technology, in two main categories. Typically an approach or a combination of approaches is chosen by management or a development team.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Traditional" methodologies such as waterfall that have distinct phases are sometimes known as 
			<b>software development life cycle</b> (SDLC) methodologies, though this term could also be used more generally to refer to any methodology. A "life cycle" approach with distinct phases is in contrast to Agile approaches which define a process of iteration, but where design, construction, and deployment of different pieces can occur simultaneously.

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development" title="Rapid application development">Rapid application development</a> (RAD) is a software development methodology, which favors

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype" title="Prototype">prototypes</a> instead of large amounts of up-front planning. The "planning" of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.

			The rapid development process starts with the development of preliminary

			<sup id="cite_ref-8">
				<a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a>
			</sup> in 1970 although Royce did not use the term "waterfall" in this article. Royce presented this model as an example of a flawed, non-working model.

				<a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a>

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Project is divided into sequential phases, with some overlap and splashback acceptable between phases.</li>
			<li>Emphasis is on planning, time schedules, target dates, budgets and implementation of an entire system at one time.</li>
			<li>

			The waterfall model is a traditional engineering approach applied to software engineering.  A strict waterfall approach discourages revisiting and revising any prior phase once it is complete. This "inflexibility" in a pure waterfall model has been a source of criticism by supporters of other more "flexible" models.  It has been widely blamed for several large-scale government projects running over budget, over time and sometimes failing to deliver on requirements due to the 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front" title="Big Design Up Front">Big Design Up Front</a> approach. Except when contractually required, the waterfall model has been largely superseded by more flexible and versatile methodologies developed specifically for software development. See

		<p>
			In 1988, 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Boehm" title="Barry Boehm">Barry Boehm</a> published a formal software system development "spiral model," which combines some key aspect of the 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" title="Waterfall model">waterfall model</a> and 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development" title="Rapid application development">rapid prototyping</a> methodologies, in an effort to combine advantages of 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design" title="Top-down and bottom-up design">top-down and bottom-up</a> concepts.  It provided emphasis in a key area many felt had been neglected by other methodologies: deliberate iterative risk analysis, particularly suited to large-scale complex systems.

			The basic principles are:

				Focus is on risk assessment and on minimizing project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process, as well as providing the opportunity to evaluate risks and weigh consideration of project continuation throughout the life cycle.
			</li>
			<li>
				"Each cycle involves a progression through the same sequence of steps, for each part of the product and for each of its levels of elaboration, from an overall concept-of-operation document down to the coding of each individual program."

			</li>
			<li>
				Each trip around the spiral traverses four basic quadrants: (1) determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints of the iteration; (2) evaluate alternatives; Identify and resolve risks; (3) develop and verify deliverables from the iteration; and (4) plan the next iteration.

		<span>The three basic approaches applied to software development methodology frameworks.</span>
		<p>
			A variety of such frameworks have evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. One software development methodology framework is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodology frameworks are best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development" title="Software development">Software development</a> organizations implement process methodologies to ease the process of development. Sometimes, contractors may require methodologies employed, an example is the U.S. 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry" title="Arms industry">defense industry</a>, which requires a rating based on 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_model" title="Process model">process models</a> to obtain contracts.  The international standard for describing the method of selecting, implementing and monitoring the life cycle for software is

			A decades-long goal has been to find repeatable, predictable processes that improve productivity and quality. Some try to systematize or formalize the seemingly unruly task of designing software. Others apply 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management" title="Project management">project management</a> techniques to designing software. Large numbers of software projects do not meet their expectations in terms of functionality, cost, or delivery schedule - see

Composed of line practitioners who have varied skills, the group is at the center of the collaborative effort of everyone in the organization who is involved with software engineering process improvement.
